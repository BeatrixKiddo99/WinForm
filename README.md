This is a MP4 player I made by windows form in c#
This was a class project only that they ask me to do the button's logic and not make it play.
So I said to myself I should make it playable so I did. I know its really basic stuff but just sharing my home works ;)

To open the media player go to OPButtonForm\OPButtonForm\bin\Debug and then OpButtonform.exe

you can view code and edit it to your liking.
